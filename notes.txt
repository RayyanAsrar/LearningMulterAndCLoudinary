*What is multer?
-multer handles file upload in express
-Multer is middleware that processes multipart/form-data - the format browsers use to send files.
-we cannot handle files in req.body as it can only handle text
-u need to install multer (npm install multer)
-multer.diskStorage({}) , expects 2 things 
    1-destination 
        - WHERE to save the file
        -function (req, file, cb) {}
    2-filename
        -WHAT to name the file
        - file object contains:
            file.originalname: Original name from user's computer
            file.mimetype: File type (image/jpeg, application/pdf, etc.)
            file.fieldname: The name from your form's input field
-we do filter too we can restrict user from uploading every file types
- then we create an instance like below
                                    *** const upload =  multer({
                                        storage:storage,
                                        fileFilter:fileFilter,
                                        limits:{
                                            fileSize:1024*1024*5 //5MB  
                                        }
                                        }) ***
-upload.single()
                 - Accept only ONE file
                 - The file input field name must be 'profilePic'
-After multer processes the upload:
            - req.file contains the uploaded file info
            - req.body contains other form fields

-  req.file contains:
   {
     fieldname: 'profilePic',
     originalname: 'my-photo.jpg',
     encoding: '7bit',
     mimetype: 'image/jpeg',
     destination: './uploads',
     filename: 'my-photo-1638472847362.jpg',
     path: 'uploads/my-photo-1638472847362.jpg',
     size: 245234 (in bytes)
   }
